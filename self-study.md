# Self-Study

## Examples
 - [Solidity baby steps](https://github.com/fivedogit/solidity-baby-steps) - a collection of ~20 contracts to demonstrate various parts of Solidity.
 - [Solidity idiosyncrasies](https://github.com/miguelmota/solidity-idiosyncrasies) - a **fantastic** one-page summary of everything unexpected in Solidity
 - [Solidity by example](https://github.com/raineorshine/solidity-by-example) - a collection of ~20 small contracts to exemplify features again

## Products
**Note**: links to Github repo's are redirected to Sourcegraph's service - this enables much easier sorting and navigation through the repository and is invaluable as an interface for learning! 

**Note 2**: contracts are annotated with their date of most recent design - this should help in understanding how the space has so rapidly evolved.

 - [DAO](https://sourcegraph.com/github.com/slockit/DAO@master/-/blob/DAO.sol) (2016) - the original Ethereum lovechild - the Decentralized Autonomous Organisation.
 - [CryptoKitties](https://github.com/cryptocopycats/awesome-cryptokitties/tree/master/contracts) (2017) - the first popular DAapp - tradable, breedable, cryptokitties!
 - [Augur](https://sourcegraph.com/github.com/AugurProject/augur-core@master/-/tree/source/contracts) (Sep 2018): the decentralised prediction market.
 - Gnosis: another prediction platform. [contracts](https://sourcegraph.com/github.com/gnosis/pm-contracts/-/tree/contracts) and those for [dutch auctions](https://sourcegraph.com/github.com/gnosis/dx-contracts/-/blob/contracts/DutchExchange.sol)

## Functionality
 - Paying for smart contract executions using tokens ([1](https://medium.com/@jgm.orinoco/ethereum-smart-service-payment-with-tokens-60894a79f75c))

## Security
 - Even the advice about how many confirmations is considered secure [is varied](https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/questions/319/what-number-of-confirmations-is-considered-secure-in-ethereum)
 - From the leading Ethereum venture studio, Consensys - [Ethereum Smart Contract Security Best Practices](https://consensys.github.io/smart-contract-best-practices/)

## Standards
List of [Ethereum Improvement Proposals](https://eips.ethereum.org/erc). Ubiquitous and/or ones to know:

 - [ERC-20](https://theethereum.wiki/w/index.php/ERC20_Token_Standard): tokens
 - [ERC-721](http://erc721.org/): unique/fungible tokens
 - [ERC-1155](https://blog.enjincoin.io/erc-1155-the-crypto-item-standard-ac9cf1c5a226): crypto items
