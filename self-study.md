# Self-Study

## Examples
 - [Solidity baby steps](https://github.com/fivedogit/solidity-baby-steps) - a collection of ~20 contracts to demonstrate various parts of Solidity.
 - [Solidity idiosyncrasies](https://github.com/miguelmota/solidity-idiosyncrasies) - a **fantastic** one-page summary of everything unexpected in Solidity
 - [Solidity by example](https://github.com/raineorshine/solidity-by-example) - a collection of ~20 small contracts to exemplify features again

## Products
**Note**: links to Github repo's are redirected to Sourcegraph's service - this enables much easier sorting and navigation through the repository and is invaluable as an interface for learning! 

**Note 2**: contracts are annotated with their date of most recent design - this should help in understanding how the space has so rapidly evolved.

 - [DAO](https://sourcegraph.com/github.com/slockit/DAO@master/-/blob/DAO.sol) - the original Ethereum lovechild - the Decentralized Autonomous Organisation.
 - [Augur](https://sourcegraph.com/github.com/AugurProject/augur-core@master/-/tree/source/contracts): the decentralised prediction market.
